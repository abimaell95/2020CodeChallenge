# Day 6 - Oddish vs. Evenish
Determine if a number is Oddish or Evenish. 

## Description
Create a function that determines whether a number is Oddish or Evenish. A number is Oddish if the sum of all of its digits is odd, and a number is Evenish if the sum of all of its digits is even. If a number is Oddish, return "Oddish". Otherwise, return "Evenish".

For example, oddish_or_evenish(121) should return "Evenish", since 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. oddish_or_evenish(41) should return "Oddish", since 4 + 1 = 5.
