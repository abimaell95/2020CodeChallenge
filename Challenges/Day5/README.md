# Day 5 - Bit Rotation
Rotate bit and print the decimal representaion of that bit.

## Description
Python offers some bit operations but not bit rotation. To complete that, create a function that takes three parameters:

1. n: Integer, which in binary representaion should be rotated.
2. m: Number of rotation steps that should be performed.
3. d: Boolean value; True = rotation right, False = rotation left.

Your function should return an integer as a result of its rotated binary representation.

## Examples
```
Input: 8,1,True
Output: 4
```

```
Input: 16,1,False
Output: 1
```
Note: Input 'True' on console if is true otherwise is false
